Gym Booker was written by Eddy (jayaristocles@gmail.com) www.makeitbreakitfixit.com - 12/Sep/2014

Gym Booker is specifically designed for Virgin Active Health Club class scheduling system, in Australia.
The current system allows members to book up to 8 days in advance. With the 8th day schedule being released at 8pm each night.
This script is designed to be run just after 8pm (via cron) and it will scrape the classes. Then, according to a pre-configured cfg file, will book your specified classes.
The Virgin Active site then sends a confirmation email to you.

You never need to miss out on a class again!

REQUIREMENTS
- Linux or Unix-like Operating System with PERL 5.x and CRON (or other scheduler)


INSTALLATION
- Decompress .the zip file in your home directory
- Edit the file config/gym_booker.cfg with your membership ID, password, and classes you wish to book
- Be sure that bin/session_grab.pl is executable (chmod +x bin/session_grab.pl)
- Add an entry in your cron to execute the script just after 8pm every night
(eg. crontab -e; add the line "10 20 * * * /var/www/gym_booker/bin/session_grab.pl | logger" in to cron)
